Creating my own website has been a goal of mine since the beginning of my developer journey, and to be honest, since my time on the internet. I've always wanted a central place to share my thoughts and work. There have been attempts, but they were all short lived. Finally.. FINALLY I can present to you this gem of a website I am so excited to share to you all.

### Beginnings

I began self-studying web development during my first semester of college. Being abroad in London (I know, crazy) was definitely a toss in the deep end, but myself and the rest of the cohort were able to adjust quite nicely. I spent lots of my free time watching videos in my dorm, teaching myself the basics. I started with the standard HTML, CSS & Javascript to learn the frontend, then went immediately to Flask to learn the backend. Because I was most proficient in Python at the time, I thought building a backend in Python would be the easiest for me. My liking for both the front and back end definitely sprouted early. I built a few low tier frontend & backend projects and a comfortable understanding of the web in about a month's time. My real passion for the field didn't arise until I started learning React and Express. Big shoutout to [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) and [Ben Awad](https://www.youtube.com/@bawad) for having gold mines of youtube content to learn from. What I'd say was helpful during my coming up as a developer, was that I began learning pretty advanced techonologies early on. The standard HTML, CSS & Javascript + whatever backend was cool, but it couldn't make the cool websites I was seeing everyone else make in the space.

### 2023

Since 2023 has started, I have been non-stop working on my craft. I am no expert or senior yet, far from it, but I have been continuing to build and learn all sorts of things. Early into my second semester, I joined a web and app development club on campus called [Oasis](https://oasisneu.com/). At Oasis, my group and I were given eight weeks to build a project of our choice. We called our project [BeGroovy](https://github.com/LOTaher/BeGroovy). It was a nice way to assess all the skills up until that point. Besides the time I put into Oasis every Sunday from February to April, I wasn't really able to work on my own personal projects. School was a priority, and web development is still my hobby after all.

After my second semester ended in May, I began building a passion project of mine, [Freehand (WIP)](https://www.drawfreehand.co/). I don't want to share much about it yet, but developing Freehand has what has been taking up the majority of my freetime this summer. The techonologies in the stack are so fun to use, and I'm excited to share more about it in the future!

### splatte.dev

Working on Freehand has been an enjoyable experience so far, and because I am working in a small team, I have time to work on other things as I wait for everyone to do their part. For the past three days I have been building the site, and with the help of some open source projects, I was able to get it up and running with relative ease. I took heavy inspiration from [Lee Robinon's personal website](https://leerob.io/) for the design and [shadcn's taxonomy github repository](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy) for setting up the blog. Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind have been the foundation of practically all my projects nowadays. It is such a powerful and satisfying stack to use. Yeah! I ask that you try to break this site in any way possible then just create an issue on Github. I haven't created a contributing guide yet, but would love to see any sort of suggestions you all have to better improve my work!

I hope this was not too hard of a read. I have never written a blog post before so hopefully I didn't embarrass myself too much with my horrid writing skills. There are a lot more things I plan on writing about so keep an eye out. Thanks for reading!
