Hey there! Welcome to my new website. If you don't know who I am already, my name is Laith Taher. I am a second year attending Northeastern Univeristy where I am studying Computer Science. Almost a year ago, I found my passion for web development. Since then, I have been learning and building non-stop. It's quite ironic that only now I create my own personal website, but better late than never, right? I wanted my first blog post to be about the process of building the site and share my thought process behind it. I hope you enjoy!

### The Stack

The technologies I used to build splatte.dev have been such a pleasure to use. The developer experience using Next.js, Typescript and Tailwind is unmatched. It's only been a month since I really started to learn Next.js in particular and I am already in love with it. Big shoutout to Vercel, those guys rock.

Also, if it isn't clear already, I took heavy inspiration from [Lee Robinson's website](https://leerob.io/). I loved the design and the simplicity of it, so I decided to use it as a base for my own. I also used [shadcn's taxonomy](https://github.com/shadcn/taxonomy) to help me get the blog up and running. I am new to MDX, contentlayer and all the other packages that make up the blog, but having that reference made the process significantly easier so thank you mr shad. Speaking of shadcn, I also used some of his [UI components](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) on the site. The dude is talented and you should definitely check out his work if you want to learn a thing or two.

For the guestbook, I am using [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) to handle the authentication. I wanted to set up NextAuth but honestly couldn't be bothered. Clerk's a super cool product, I just hope I don't get paywalled at any point of this site's life. The database I am using to hold guestbook entries is [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/). It's the first time I use them, and their free tier is quite generous. I am using [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) to handle all of the databse queries. It has definitely been my favorite tool to use with a full-stack Typescript environment.

Lastly, I am hosting the website on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Deploying honestly couldn't be easier. I haven't ran into any problems yet so no complaints here!

### Conclusion

Thanks for giving my first ever blog a read through! Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself with the horrid writing. More blogs soon to come. Check out all my links below!
